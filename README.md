# ECE-387-Midterm-Project
Ethernet Port and Cable

# Introduction
For my 387 Midterm Project I chose to research and create a project using the ethernet port and cable. The ethernet cable is used for connecting devices to a network router for internet connection or creating local area networks. What interested me the most about ethernet was the ability to send information much faster than wireless connections with much higher efficiency. Ethernet cables are also faster than serial connections. To explore how to use this technology I connected two raspberry pi 3's via ethernet to create a local network.
